One purpose of ROIs is to show only subsets of fiber tracking results passing through an interesting region. It is possible to add multiple ROIs. With more than one ROI, connections between the ROIs are shown.

You can move the ROI with a right button mouse drag, or with the x,y,z-sliders in the ROIProperties view. In that view, changing the shape or the color of the ROI is also possible.
